### Work Experience

Data Scientist Intern at Amazon (2021.5-2021.8)
- Find reasons behind the inaccuracy of the current capacity demand forecast model, then implement a more accurate model.
- Design metrics and visualizations to compare between old model forecast, new model forecast, and human manual forecast

### Research Experience

**Resrarch Asistant at Fluid Energy Science lab at University of California, Santabarbara (2018.3-2020.6)**

The Big Question: Hard to sustain vortices in liquids in small scale channels to mix two
different fluids

Solution: Search for a silicon channel with certain structures that could sustain vortices in the
liquid

Research and Result
- Built different silicon cells in which there is a channel of 1000 m width with small
structures of the scale tens of m, and two inlets for two different fluids and one outlet for
outflow. Used syringe pump to push liquids passing through the cell. Use fluids with
fluorescent beads to record the flow using a fluorescence confocal microscope and analyze
it with micro-PIV analysis
- Managed to have two working structures
1. Constant Pumping: Successfully created non-dying vortices in the fluids inside the
cell
2. Stop-and-go Pumping: Successfully created periodic vortices along the channel.
- Upon successfully creating and sustaining the vortices, mixing is guaranteed
- The next step would be to input fluids containing different fluorescents beads and measure
the mixing efficiency by calculating the standard deviation of the distribution of beads

**Resrarch Asistant at Bio-Engineering lab at the University of Tokyo (2018.6-2018.8)**

The Big Question: To describe the reaction between Mechanical Stress and Biological Cell
on the pico-second time scale
- Solution: Investigate the interaction using traditional high-speed camera, develop a new
pulse laser-based imaging technique have faster imaging speed and can capture sequential
image
- Research and Result:
- Used pulse laser and ink to generate the acoustic wave, and developed cancer cells using
cell culturing
- Successfully used traditional high-speed camera to capture the interaction moment
between acoustic wave and cell
- Used image processing software to reduce the noise and detect the edge of the cell to
determine the deformation of cell wall
